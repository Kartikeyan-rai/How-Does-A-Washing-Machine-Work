    <h4>Why Do The Washing Machines Break Down</h4>
    <p style="font-size: medium;">Washing machines can break down because of several different reasons.<br> But there are
        two main reasons which is
        quite common.<br> The first is that you may not use or maintaned your washing machine properly. And the second is
        that one of the washer’s parts may breaks down.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The most common parts which break down:
        &nbsp;<br>
        The motor: When you overuse your washing machine, the motor of the washer may fail.<br> In this situation, the motor
        may overheat and stop working.<br> When this happens, you can wait for your machine cool down and restart it again.
        <br> However, if the motor of your washer overheats regularly, it may be the sign that your motor goes bad.<br> It needs
        to call a repairmen before it is too late.<br>&nbsp;<br>
        The pump: As the pump is made of plastic, it can break or leak easily which causes water to drain out onto your
        floor. A blockage can also happen in the pump, causing the water can’t circulate.&nbsp;<br>
        Hose: A clogged house may be another reason fort he breakdowns.<br> The water does not drain as it should. The first
        thing you can do is to locate the hose and check if there are any clogs.<br> When you locate the hose, remove it,
        clean the hose with some water and loosen the blockage.&nbsp;<br>
        The gaskets: The gasket’s job is to prevent water from any leaking.<br> When it wears out, the water begin to leak.
        <br>Except from these parts of the washing machine, there might be other reasons to your washer break down.
        &nbsp;<br>
        Overloading: Washing machine drums has their own capacities.<br> And when you exceed this capacity, it may cause a
        break down in your washer.

        When your washing machine is unable to spin or agitate, it may be sign that you are overloading your washing
        machine. Remember adjust your load when you wash your clothes.
        &nbsp;<br>
        Oversudsing: Using hot water in your washing machine can make use of less detergent.<br> And, using cold water
        require too much detergent, causing to oversudsing. To fix it, try to reduce the amount of detergent you use.<br>
